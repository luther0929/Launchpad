# Launchpad – AI Resume Optimizer (Experimental)

A small proof-of-concept **SaaS resume builder** designed to help jobseekers **optimize their resumes for ATS (Applicant Tracking System) scoring**.  
Built with **React + TypeScript + Vite**, this experiment explores automated keyword analysis, AI-driven suggestions, and real-time optimization insights.

🔗 **Live Demo:** [launchpad-prototype.netlify.app](https://launchpad-prototype.netlify.app)

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **React 18** + **TypeScript**
- **Vite** (blazing fast dev environment)
- **TailwindCSS** (modern UI styling)
- **Netlify** (for deployment)

## 🧠 Concept
This project experiments with a potential business idea:  
> A SaaS platform where users upload their resume and job description →  
> the system analyzes and scores them →  
> provides actionable recommendations to improve ATS compatibility.

The goal is to validate the **technical feasibility and user flow**, not yet full productization.
